 * Plan the `skipped_expired` scan-history rows for a batch of liveness verdicts.
 *
 * The pure half of recording a liveness sweep (#3891). Kept here rather than in
 * the CLI so its four invariants are testable without a browser:
 *
 *   - **Only `expired`.** `uncertain` is a timeout or a bot wall, never a death
 *     certificate; recording it would bury a live posting behind a network
 *     hiccup, a strictly worse failure than the one this closes.
 *   - **Not an unrendered page.** The browser rung reads a page under 300
 *     characters with no closure notice and no apply control as
 *     `insufficient_content`, which is mostly a page that had not rendered yet.
 *     AGENTS.md calls a loading placeholder unconfirmed, not closed, and
 *     batch-evaluate-gemini.mjs skips the same code. A dead posting that reads
 *     this way gets no row, as it did before this recorder existed.
 *   - **Only URLs the history already knows.** A liveness sweep is not a
 *     discovery channel: a URL scan-history never saw has no row to retire, and
 *     inventing one would put a posting nothing surfaced into the dedup set.
 *   - **Once each.** A URL already carrying an expired row is left alone, so
 *     re-running the sweep is idempotent.
 *
 * A planned row is emitted under the history's OWN spelling of the URL, not the
 * caller's: the web feed keys its dedup on the verbatim `url` cell, so a row
 * written under a different spelling would not line up with the `added` row it
 * exists to retire. Matching is done through the injected `normalizeUrl` (the
 * scanner's `normalizeUrlForDedup`) rather than an import, so this module stays
 * free of scan.mjs — liveness-browser.mjs imports it.
 *
 * @param {string} scanHistoryText - Raw data/scan-history.tsv contents ('' when absent).
 * @param {{url: string, result: string, code?: string}[]} verdicts - One entry per checked URL.
 * @param {(url: string) => string} [normalizeUrl] - Dedup-key normalizer.
 * @returns {{url: string, source: string, title: string, company: string, location: string, fingerprint: string}[]}
 *   Offer-shaped rows for `appendToScanHistory(rows, date, 'skipped_expired')`.
