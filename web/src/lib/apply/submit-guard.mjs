/**
 * submit-guard.mjs — the one definition of "this control submits the form",
 * shared by the two places in the agentic drive loop that have to agree on it
 * (`web/src/lib/apply/drive.ts`): the snapshot that decides which elements the
 * planner may address, and the action path that executes what it picked.
 *
 * NEVER-SUBMIT is by construction for the planner's ACTION VOCABULARY
 * (`web/AGENTS.md`: "There is no exception, no flag"): there is no "submit"
 * action to issue, a control this guard recognises as a submit control is
 * listed with no ref so it cannot be named, and the guard cannot rest on a
 * string the planner never saw. The snapshot labels an element
 * `aria-label || placeholder || text || value || name`; the click guard used
 * to test `innerText || value` only, which is empty for an icon-only
 * `<button aria-label="Submit application">`, against a regex of English and
 * Spanish words, which does not contain "Absenden" or "Отправить". Both call
 * sites now read the same element facts and call the same predicate.
 *
 * What this does NOT construct away: an allowed control's own JS handler can
 * still call `form.submit()`/`requestSubmit()` on a click this guard has no
 * wording or shape to object to (a `<button type="button">Continue</button>`
 * that quietly files the form). No DOM heuristic closes that; only an
 * independent interlock on the `submit`/`requestSubmit` event itself would,
 * and that is the documented next step (PR body, "Out of scope"), not this
 * guard's job.
 *
 * Plain .mjs (same pattern as exit.mjs / cv-match.mjs) so `node --test` imports
 * it with no build step and every branch can be pinned in a test.
 */

/**
 * The facts both call sites decide on, read from the live DOM by `drive.ts`:
 *
 * - `tag`          lowercase tag name
 * - `type`         the authored `type` attribute, lowercased ("" when absent).
 *                  Not `el.type`: the DOM resolves a missing button type to
 *                  "submit", which would hide the case below it.
 * - `role`         explicit role, else the tag (`a` reads as "link")
 * - `inForm`       the element belongs to a `<form>`
 * - `aria` `placeholder` `text` `value` `name`  the label sources, raw. `aria`
 *                  is the accessible name: `aria-label`, or the text of the
 *                  `aria-labelledby` targets when there is no `aria-label`.
 * - `title` `alt`  further names an icon-only control can carry. Classification
 *                  only: they never reach the snapshot line (see snapshotLabel).
 *
 * @typedef {{ tag?: string, type?: string, role?: string, inForm?: boolean,
