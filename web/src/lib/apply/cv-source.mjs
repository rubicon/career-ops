/**
 * A READABLE path to the tailored CV the apply flow uploads, so the planner
 * drafting the structured answers reads the document the reviewer is holding.
 *
 * Resolution goes through the `pdf` column of `data/pdf-index.tsv`, instead of a
 * second match over `output/`. generate-pdf.mjs drops any existing row naming
 * the same PDF, so a PDF path identifies at most one row. That row's `html`
 * column is that PDF's own source.
 *
 * Matching the company or the report number again would be a second, independent
 * lookup that can disagree with the first. By the company, because two roles at
 * one employer share it. By the report number, because updatePDFManifest also
 * drops every row carrying the report number it is given. The manifest keeps at
 * most one row per report. A cover letter rendered for that report evicts the
 * CV's row and answers in its place.
 *
 * Falls back to the PDF itself when no rendering survives. A missing rendering
 * still leaves that PDF going into the form, so name it. Treating it as an
 * absent tailored CV puts back the contradiction this resolver prevents.
 *
 * @param {string} root - Career-ops workspace root (see careerOpsRoot()).
 * @param {string | undefined | null} pdfPath - The attached CV, absolute or root-relative.
 * @returns {string | null} Root-relative path to the CV to draft from, or null.
