/**
 * apply-prefill-cv-source.test.mjs — the two halves of one application must
 * describe the same document.
 *
 * /api/apply/fill uploads the tailored CV that `pdf` mode built for this offer,
 * resolved by resolveTailoredCv(). /api/apply/prefill drafts the structured
 * answers typed into that same form. When the prompt sends the planner to master
 * cv.md, a reviewer reads a resume and a set of answers that disagree: bullets
 * are reselected per offer, role framing is rewritten toward the employer's
 * domain, and engagements are regrouped. The candidate never sees the mismatch,
 * because both halves look right on their own.
 *
 * So the assertion is a join, not a wording check: resolve the CV the fill route
 * attaches, then require the prefill prompt to name that document.
 *
 * applyCvSource() is the seam between them. It reads the `pdf` column of
 * data/pdf-index.tsv and answers with the row's readable rendering, so the
 * planner gets a document it can actually open.
 *
 * Run (from web/):  node --test tests/lib/apply-prefill-cv-source.test.mjs
