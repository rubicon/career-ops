// "", buildPrompt() drops the whole "Durable notes about the user" section
// rather than emitting an empty one, so a run with no guardrails is
// byte-indistinguishable from a run that never had any. Nothing errors, nothing
// is logged, and the output looks exactly like correctly constrained output.
// That is why the last test here asserts on the built PROMPT and not only on
// this function's return value.
