/**
 * Whether this document contains count claims the extractor could not read.
 *
 * METRIC_NOUNS is an English word list, and COUNT_CLAIM_RE's modifier window is
 * `[A-Za-z]`. Percentages, currency and multipliers are language-neutral and
 * still checked everywhere — but a COUNT is checked only in English, and this
 * file's own METRIC_NOUNS comment names counts as the class that gets inflated:
 * "Managed 45 staff against a source saying 20 passed the gate silently, which
 * is the exact fabrication class this script exists to catch."
 *
 * For a CV written in one of the market languages the project ships modes for,
 * that sentence is true of EVERY count, not only the ones outside the list:
 *
 *   ES  "Gestioné 45 empleados en 3 instalaciones."  -> 0 count claims, pass
 *   DE  "Leitete 45 Mitarbeiter an 3 Standorten."    -> 0 count claims, pass
 *   JA  "3拠点で45名のスタッフを管理。"                   -> 0 count claims, pass
 *
 * AGENTS.md makes non-English output a first-class case (`language.output`
 * governs "reports, tracker notes, PDFs, cover letters ... any user-visible
 * prose"), so this is not an edge.
 *
 * Reporting it rather than blocking is the same choice jd-skill-gap.mjs's
 * diagnoseExtraction() and story-provenance-check.mjs's diagnose() make, and
 * for the reason story-provenance states outright: so "an empty/near-empty
 * result isn't misread as 'scanned and clean'". Blocking instead would fail
 * every non-English document, trading a silent gap for a wall.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY CONSERVATIVE. It fires only when the document has two or more
 * count-shaped spans and the extractor produced NO count claim at all — a
 * document where the lexicon reached something is assumed to be reaching it in
 * the language it was written in. Under-reporting is the right direction for a
 * signal added to a gate every generated document already runs.
 *
 * TWO KNOWN BLIND SPOTS, stated rather than implied:
 *
 *   - Coincidental coverage. French "3 sites" matches the English noun, so one
 *     recognised count silences the warning for a French CV whose other counts
 *     are invisible.
 *   - CJK. This detector needs whitespace: it locates a count by a digit run
 *     that is not preceded by a letter and is followed by one. Japanese and
 *     Chinese put digits flush against the surrounding text ("3拠点で45名"),
 *     so the second number is preceded by a letter and is not seen at all.
 *     Relaxing the lookbehind to fix that would match digits inside Latin
 *     identifiers, so it needs script-aware segmentation rather than a looser
 *     regex — separate work, and the reason this is a partial answer.
 *
 * So this closes the silent pass for space-delimited languages (de, es, tr, pt,
 * it, pl, ru, ...). A ja/zh CV can still reach 'pass' unchecked, which is why
 * the real answer is a lexicon those languages are in, not a better detector.
