// tests/failure-excerpt.test.mjs — a failed node:test suite must surface the
// line that carries the measured value, not just the frames below it (#4017).
//
// The defect: test-all.mjs printed a failed node:test child's output as
// `.split('\n').filter(Boolean).slice(-12)` — the LAST twelve non-empty lines.
// node's runner prints the AssertionError message near the TOP of a failure
// block and the stack frames and error properties below it, so the twelve-line
// window keeps the frames and drops the message.
//
// The message is the only place an assertion's interpolated value appears.
// Measured on node 24 against a one-assertion suite: 25 non-empty lines, the
// message at line 15, so the window began three lines after it. What CI showed
// was `code: 'ERR_ASSERTION', actual: false, expected: true` — true of every
// failed assert.ok in the repository, and therefore of no diagnostic use.
//
// That made a timing flake undiagnosable by construction. #4017 reports
// `assert.ok(elapsed >= 400, ...)` failing intermittently on windows-latest;
// whether `elapsed` came back near 100 (the lock fingerprint degenerating, a
// real bug) or near 390 (clock jitter, a test-tuning problem) picks between two
// entirely different fixes, and the number lived on the dropped line.
//
// So the excerpt keeps the error headers the tail window cuts off, and keeps
// the tail as well — the frames are what locate the assertion, the message is
// what explains it. Neither alone is enough.
//
// Run:  node --test tests/failure-excerpt.test.mjs

// `node --test` output for a single failing assert.ok, captured verbatim on
// node 24.20.0. Only the absolute path of the temporary suite is shortened, so
// the line ORDER and COUNT — the properties this test is about — are untouched.
// 25 non-empty lines; the twelve-line window begins at line 14; the message is
// line 13. It misses by one, which is why the defect was invisible: the output
// looks complete and the first frame is right there.
