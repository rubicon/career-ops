// tests/domain-filter-board-gate.test.mjs — the opt-in company-level gate for
// the reverse sweep (#3105): a board with no domain-bearing posting is skipped
// before any title is filtered.
//
// Two things here are worth more than the rest, because they are the two a
// later refactor is most likely to undo without noticing:
//
//   1. ABSENT domain_filter must produce null, not a permissive predicate.
//      Every portals.yml written before this feature is in that state, and the
//      gate silently swallowing boards for them is the one outcome that must
//      never happen.
//   2. The default matching mode is WHOLE WORD. An implementation that made it
//      `stem:` would still pass a naive "matches Blockchain" assertion while
//      admitting Deficiência, Defiance, Software Defined and Product Definition
//      — the 25-of-28 junk majority the gate exists to remove. The junk cases
//      below are what tells the two apart.
