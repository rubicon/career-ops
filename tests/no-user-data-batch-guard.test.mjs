// tests/no-user-data-batch-guard.test.mjs — the PR guard covers batch/, and
// still lets the tracked sources under it through (#4531).
//
// batch/ is where the batch workers write their output: tailored CV and
// cover-letter JSON, prefetched job-description text, per-run state. That is
// user-layer content by DATA_CONTRACT.md's definition even though the scripts
// that produce it are system layer, and .github/workflows/no-user-data.yml had
// no pattern for it — a staged batch/cv-*.json passed the guard and printed
// "OK". .gitignore stops the accident; this guard is the layer that stops a
// deliberate `git add -f` and the next generator name that outruns the ignore
// rules.
//
// The guard is a blanket ^batch/ with the tracked sources exempted by name, so
// the two halves below are both load-bearing. Blocking without the exemption
// would wall off every edit to batch-runner.sh; exempting without the block
// would restore the original hole.
//
// The guard also has to keep pace with update-system.mjs's USER_PATHS: a
// user-layer path added there and not here (documents/, modes/_brief.md —
// #4891) is private data the guard waves through. The last test below fails
// the moment the two lists drift, unless the gap is allowlisted with a reason.
//
// The predicate is EVALUATED out of the workflow, not pattern-matched in it.
// A regex-over-source check passes on a USER_PATHS entry that an isScaffold
// change has quietly neutered, which is exactly the drift worth catching.
//
// Run:  node --test tests/no-user-data-batch-guard.test.mjs
