// ── Verdict (lead) block presence across evaluation modes ──
// The lead block is a report-contract element, so the contract guard has to
// assert it. It cannot join REQUIRED_HEADINGS in test-all.mjs's localized
// oferta.md parity check. That list matches literal substrings, the heading
// noun is translated per locale, and every translated mode quotes the English
// form in prose as an example of the convention, so a
// literal `## Verdict (lead)` entry would pass on zh, zh-TW and ru whether or
// not those files carry a block. The `(lead)` marker is the language-invariant
// part, and it is what cleanHeading in web/src/lib/report-sections.mjs reads,
// so this matches the marker on a heading line. A heading line is not by
// itself proof of a real block: every one of these files also illustrates the
// block inside a fenced example, and those examples carry heading lines too.
// What separates the template from documentation about it is the window. The
// template is the one place where `## G)` is followed by `## Risk Summary`,
// so the lead heading is required inside that run. Anchoring the run on the
// LAST of each marker does not work: modes/tr/is-ilani.md puts its template
// first and its prose second, so its last `## G)` and last `## Risk Summary`
// sit ~140 lines apart and swallow the document.
// Keyed on the report skeleton instead of the filename: a locale whose
// evaluation mode is not named oferta.md (tr/is-ilani.md, ja/kyujin.md,
// ar/fursah.md) is invisible to the oferta.md walk in test-all.mjs. A file
// still at the pre-Block-G shape has no Block G for the lead block to follow,
// so it drops out by carrying no `## H)` and no `## Risk Summary`, with no
// allowlist to maintain.
