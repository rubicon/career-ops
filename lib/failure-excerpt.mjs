// lib/failure-excerpt.mjs — choose which lines of a failed child suite's output
// are worth printing (#4017).
//
// test-all.mjs runs every node:test suite in a child process and, on failure,
// printed the last twelve non-empty lines of its output. node's runner prints
// the error message ABOVE the stack frames, so that window reliably kept the
// frames and dropped the message — and the message is the only place an
// assertion's interpolated value appears. A failed `assert.ok(elapsed >= 400,
// \`gave up after \${elapsed}ms\`)` showed `actual: false, expected: true`,
// which is true of every failed assert.ok in the repository.
//
// Keep the headers the window cuts off, and keep the window. The frames locate
// the assertion; the message explains it.

/**
 * Lines that open an error block: `AssertionError [ERR_ASSERTION]: ...`,
 * `TypeError: ...`, `Error: ...`. Anchored so an `at ...` frame mentioning a
 * path with "Error" in it is not mistaken for a header.
