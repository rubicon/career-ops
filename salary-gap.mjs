/**
 * salary-gap.mjs — Desired vs Advertised vs Actual compensation analyzer
 *
 * Salary facts are append-only observations, never mutated:
 *   { tracker#, date, type: desired|advertised|actual|stated, amount, currency, source, note, round, interviewer }
 *
 * Sources folded on read (one write path per fact):
 *   1. reports/{###}-*.md Machine Summary `advertised_comp`  -> advertised (source: jd)
 *   2. data/salary-observations.tsv (user-layer, append-only) -> desired/actual/stated (+ corrections)
 *   3. config/profile.yml compensation.target_range           -> desired default (source: profile)
 *
 * Fold: per (tracker#, type), highest trust tier wins, then latest date.
 *   actual:     contract > offer-letter > recruiter-verbal > user
 *   desired:    user > profile
 *   advertised: user > recruiter-verbal > jd
 *
 * `stated` observations are a separate, narrower-purpose log: a specific number
 * the candidate verbally committed to, in a specific interview round, to a
 * specific interviewer — so a later round doesn't accidentally contradict it.
 * They carry no trust tier and never participate in the fold/gap math above;
 * look them up with getStatedObservations() or `--stated-for <tracker#>`.
 *
 * Relocation purchasing-power (#4694, jurisdiction-compliance-lens umbrella #2026):
 * a transparent, bracket-tax-only comparison between a candidate's home
 * province/state and a posting's destination, keyed off
 * templates/jurisdiction-relocation-tax.yml. Every folded application also
 * gets a `relocation` field when a posting location, an advertised figure, a
 * resolvable home location, and the table are all available — absence of any
 * of those is "not evaluated," never a guessed penalty. NOT financial or tax
 * advice; see that table's own header for the full disclaimer.

 *      node salary-gap.mjs --self-test
 *
 * `--posting-location` vs `--posting-location-file` (#4696 CodeRabbit CWE-78
 * finding): the posting location is the JD's own verbatim text — untrusted,
 * external, JD-author-controlled. `modes/oferta.md` Signal 17 and
 * `batch/batch-prompt.md`'s batch-worker equivalent (which runs with
 * `--dangerously-skip-permissions`) both call this script from an agent-
 * constructed Bash command. Interpolating that JD text directly into a
 * double-quoted `--posting-location "<JD location>"` argument lets a crafted
 * location containing `$(...)` or backticks execute as a shell command
 * substitution before this script ever sees the string. `--posting-location-file
 * <path>` sidesteps that only when the raw JD text never enters shell syntax:
 * the agent first base64-encodes the complete UTF-8 location as a pure text
 * transformation, then a fixed `node -e` decoder writes those bytes to a
 * temporary file. A quoted heredoc is not safe because JD text equal to its
 * fixed delimiter can close it early. The command line receives only the
 * base64 alphabet and the agent-chosen file PATH, never raw JD text.
 * `--posting-location`
 * itself is unchanged and still accepted (e.g. for trusted/short values typed
 * directly by a human), but the prompt-spec instructions in `modes/oferta.md`
 * and `batch/batch-prompt.md` now use the file form for the JD-controlled
 * value specifically.

 * Rewrite a number's separators into a form parseFloat reads correctly.
 *
 * #3174 taught this file that a period can be thousands grouping ("35.000" is
 * 35000, not 35), which is how Spain, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and
 * Brazil write a salary. It did that with `.replace(/,/g, '')` first, though,
 * which silently assumes the comma is ALWAYS grouping — and in every one of
 * those same markets the comma is the DECIMAL point. So the half of the
 * convention that carries cents was left folding by 1000:
 *
 *   "45.000,00"  -> strip commas -> "45.00000" -> 45      (want 45000)
 *   "120.000,00" -> strip commas -> "120.00000" -> 120    (want 120000)
 *
 * The period rule could not rescue those, because after the comma is deleted
 * the period is followed by five digits and its "exactly three" lookahead
 * fails. Which separator means what has to be decided BEFORE either is
 * touched.
 *
 * @param {string} numStr - The numeric run, currency already stripped.

/**
 * Resolve applications from tracker rows, reaching each row's report through
 * its Report link — the same way `set-status.mjs`, `outcome.mjs` and
 * `check-jd-archive.mjs` already do it.
 *
 * Column 1 of `salary-observations.tsv` is documented as a tracker#, but this
 * file used to build its application map from `reports/NNN-*.md` filenames, so
 * it was really joining on report#. Those are two independent counters that
 * "diverge permanently once any row exists without a report" (set-status.mjs),
 * which had three consequences (#4351): a report-less row could never match and
 * every observation on it was called an orphan; and once an id was padded to
 * silence that orphan, the figure attached to whichever report happened to carry
 * the same number — a different company, with no warning.
 *
 * Identity rules, in order:
 *   1. A tracker row owns its own id. Company and role come from the row, so a
 *      recruiter-sourced or backfilled row with no report folds like any other.
 *   2. A report the tracker does not link still registers under its own number,
 *      but only if no tracker row already claims that id. This keeps working for
 *      logs written before the tracker carried Report links, without letting a
 *      report re-take an id that belongs to a row.
 *   3. A collision — report R exists, a tracker row is also numbered R, and
 *      that report belongs to a different row — resolves to the tracker row and
 *      is reported in `quality.ambiguousIds`, because a log written under the old
 *      report#-join semantics means something different now and that should be
 *      visible rather than silent.
 *   4. A report linked from more than one tracker row (a repost, a duplicate
 *      row) belongs to the first row in tracker order. Only that row receives its
 *      advertised figure, so one posting is never counted as two applications;
 *      every other linking row is named in `quality.sharedReports`.
 *   5. A Report link whose numeric label disagrees with its target
 *      (`[5](../reports/006-globex-….md)`) names one report, the target — the
 *      file this row will actually be joined against. Attaching both numbers
 *      put two companies' advertised figures on one row, and the fold then kept
 *      whichever arrived last. The label is reported in
 *      `quality.mislabeledReports` instead, because it is a tracker typo the
 *      user should fix, not a second application.
 *
 * @param {object[]} rows - Parsed tracker rows from `parseTrackerRow`.
 * @param {Map<string,object>} reportsByNum - Normalised report# -> `reportToObservation` result.
 * @returns {{apps: object, observations: object[], ambiguousIds: object[], sharedReports: object[], mislabeledReports: object[]}}
